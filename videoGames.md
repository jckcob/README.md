# Video Games


1. Minecraft
This was my childhood game I would always default to playing this game whenever I had free time to play. This is the best game ever don't argue with me on it.

2. Roblox
I played this game mainly as a way to connect to my younger brother and cousins. Despite how *stupid* the game looks it is still a very fun game.

3. League of Legends
This game has its moments. I only still play because my friends do.
