# Music Bands

## Cold Play

Cold Play is a band that is really nostalgic for me. My parents used to play it a lot in my house when I was younger.
Sadly the lead singer got a divorce and I think he kinda lost his touch for music since...

Favorite song: ***The Scientist***


## System of a Down

This is a band I started listening to in college. My neighbor played it when we were showering together I told him I liked it then
he shared me his playlists and now I listen to it.

Favorite song: ***Soldiers Side***

## Eminem 

Eminem is a very good rapper in the way that his raps flow and they also tell a story. It's also fascinating to see his music change
as he gets older.

Favorite song: ***The Real Slim Shady***


I do appreciate the old orchestra and piano composers unfortunately Liszt, Mozart and Tchaikovsky haven't dropped a new album in years.:(
