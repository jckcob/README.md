# TV shows

1. Star Wars The Clone Wars
The marketed this show as a "childrens show" but that is full of lies. It explored really matured content that flew over my head
as a young kid so when I grew up and went back to this show it was really good because I finally understood the message 
the show was trying to convey.

2. Demon Slayer
The animation team really put their heart and soul into this show and it really shows with how detailed the animation is.
The show also does a really good job at blending 2d art with 3d objects which is very hard to balance when making a show.

3. Jujutsu Kaisen
One of my first animes I watched was naruto and this show basically does what naruto does but without the filler arcs inbetween.
The show has significantly better pacing and the characters are more realatable to real people.
