# Hobbies

## Violin
I played violin for over 9 years but after 9 years I still don't think I am very good but I really enjoy playing it.

## Playing boardgames with friends or family
Board games are fun. I prefer board games over video games because of the real life interaction and I am not bounded by the rules of the virtual world.
1. Coup
2. Secret Hitler
3. Chess
4. Risk
5. Catan

## Investing into stocks that barely break even
I wouldn't say I am the best investor that is why I am doing IT instead of finance but I do live by the philosophy of not pulling out 
of the market when there is a dip.
